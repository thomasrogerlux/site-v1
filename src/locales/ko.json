Now I’m working on my graduation project (2018 - 2020), Citynette, where I’m in charge of all DevOps related tasks (continuous integration, deployments and infrastructure) as well as the web development related tasks (website and back-office)."

I also studied one year at Inha University in Incheon, South Korea (2019 - 2020) where I was in Computer Engineering major. However I think that as a developer it’s important to be able to study by myself, that’s why I also participated to multiple hackathons, keynotes, workshops and online courses."
